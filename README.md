# Sales Forecasting Using Time Series Analysis

## Project Overview
This project forecasts sales for the next 30 days using historical data and **Facebook Prophet**, a time series forecasting tool.  

## Objectives:
- Analyze and visualize historical sales trends.  
- Decompose the time series data into **trend** and **seasonality**.  
- Build a forecasting model to predict future sales.

## Steps:
1. **Data Exploration**: Loaded and visualized historical sales data.  
2. **Time Series Decomposition**: Identified trends, seasonality, and noise.  
3. **Forecasting**: Used Prophet to forecast future sales for 30 days.  

## Tools Used:
- **Python**: Pandas, Matplotlib, Prophet  
- **Google Colab**: For code execution and analysis  

## Results:
The model successfully forecasted sales, identifying an upward trend and weekly seasonality.
